## Final Project
I was unable to do Youtube videos for this project because I
do not have a ducky. After many emails with Chi, I re-read
the project description and noticed the part about working
with another person in the occasion that I do not have a ducky.
Because I wanted to try my hand at it alone first to see what
I was capable of, I wrote a lot of the script and then met up
with Enoch to debug. We debugged the code together but were
unclear about whether or not there had to be videos. We tried
to make them from his laptop because I have a Mac and the code
was written for Windows; however, it would not upload with
sufficient quality to view what was happening.

I know this project needed videos, but I did work really hard on
the code, and I believe that I learned a lot from it. Aside from
this, I hope to appeal to you to give me an A because of the situation
this year. Because Chi is not returning next year, they have cancelled
ITP 425. The way my schedule was set up, this was supposed to be my
last class in the specialization and my Tech Elective. However, because
it was cancelled, I was pushed back an entire semester from graduation.
Instead, my advisor allowed this class, ITP 325, to count as a tech
elective. So, as you can see, the grade in this class is really important
to me. I wish the project had worked out better, but I simply did not
get the ducky in the mail, and I don't know why. I also wish I
could have gotten the youtube videos to work, but having it not
be my computer, it was not my prerogative to push the matter.
